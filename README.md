# TOP---RockPaperScissors
Welcome to my Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript Project!

Special thanks to @Rachel Bannana from the TOP Discord Channel for helping me talk through my code!

This project was performed to test and display the working knowledge of JavaScript I have up to this date. In total, the project took me just shy of 3 1/2 hours to complete. This may seem like a lot of time, but compared to my first HTML/CSS project; this was lightning speed! The entirety of this game runs in the console of an HTML page and the scripts were written internally on the HTML page.

This project demonstrates:
-Declaring variables
-Defining functions
-Random selection
-Nesting
-Loops
-Taking user input
